Collection of Projects on Cloud Computing and Infrastructure from CSEN241 Winter 2024 at SCU

## 1. [Text Summarizer](https://github.com/eshaanrathi2/Text-Summarizer)
Built and deployed full stack Machine Learning application to summarize texts with LLMs and Cloud Technologies. Scales to over 50 requests/sec with < 9 sec latency.
Tech: AWS, Python, React, Serverless / Lambda, REST APIs, LLMs, DynamoDB, IAM


## 2. Virtualization v/s Containerization
Objectives:
1. System Virtualization via QEMU
    * Spawn VMs with different combinations of memory, image types, cpu cores etc.
2. OS Virtualization via Docker (Containerization)

Measure CPU, Memory, File I/O and Networking performance differences of each technology using benchmarks (sysbench). Automate all the tests with shell scripts.
* Tech: QEMU, Docker, Shell scripting, Linux

## 3. Serverless Infrastructure
Objectives:
* Develop a ChatBot on Serverless Infrastructure that can deployed on Discord
* Understanding the in-and-out of serverless computing
    * How serverless workloads are written
    * How serverless workloads are executed in terms of OpenFaaS
* Monitor serverless compute workloads
* Tech: Python, OpenFass, Linux

## 4. Software Defined Networking
Objectives:
* Use Mininet, OpenFlow and POX to develop custom data center topology and measure network performance
* Understand how the control plane works
* Create MAC Learning Controller (smart switching)
* Tech: TCP/IP stack, Docker, POX, Linux, Python
